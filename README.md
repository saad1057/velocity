## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/96f7778d-78bc-4537-8ef2-7b562cd302d1) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Backend Setup

The backend API is located in the `backend/` directory.

1. **Navigate to backend directory**:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file**:
   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and configure your environment variables (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.)

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The API will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for detailed backend documentation.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**
